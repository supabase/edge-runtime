# Supabase Edge Runtime

A web server based on [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime, capable of running JavaScript, TypeScript, and WASM services.
Edge Runtime is built and maintained by the [Supabase team](https://supabase.io). For more details, read the [intro blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/edge-runtime-self-hosted-deno-functions).

You can use it to:

* Locally test and self-host Supabase's Edge Functions (or any Deno Function)
* As a programmable HTTP Proxy: You can intercept / route HTTP requests

**WARNING: Beta Software. There will be breaking changes to APIs / Configuration Options**

## Architecture

![Sequence diagram of Edge Runtime request flow](assets/edge-runtime-diagram.svg?raw=true)

The edge runtime can be divided into two runtimes with different purposes.
- Main runtime:
  - An instance for the _main runtime_ is responsible for proxying the transactions to the _user runtime_.
  - The main runtime is meant to be an entry point before running user functions, where you can authentication, etc. before calling the user function.
  - Has no user-facing limits
  - Has access to all environment variables.
- User runtime:
  - An instance for the _user runtime_ is responsible for executing users' code.
  - Limits are required to be set such as: Memory and Timeouts.
  - Has access to environment variables explictly allowed by the main runtime.
