/**
 * A parser for the server-sent events stream format.
 *
 * Note that this parser does not handle text decoding! To do it correctly, use a streaming text decoder, since the
 * stream could be split up mid-Unicode character, and decoding each chunk at once could lead to incorrect results.
 *
 * This parser is used by streaming chunks in using the {@link push} method, and then calling the {@link end} method
 * when the stream has ended.
